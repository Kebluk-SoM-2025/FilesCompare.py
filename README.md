# FilesCompare.py

This Python script helps you compare the files in a directory with the recursive file log generated by [TestDisk](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk). It identifies files that are missing, extra, or excluded, making it easier to verify the completeness of your recovered data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher

## Installation

You can use FilesCompare in two ways:

### Option 1: Run as a Python Script

1. Install Python 3.8 or higher from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Option 2: Use the Windows Executable

1. Download the pre-built Windows executable (.exe) from the [Releases](https://github.com/Kebluk-SoM-2025/FilesCompare.py/releases) page.

## Usage

You can run FilesCompare using either method:

### If using the Python script:

```powershell
python FilesCompare.py
```

### If using the Windows executable:

Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file or run it from the command line.

The script will prompt you for:

- The path to your root directory (where your files are located)
- The path to your TestDisk log file (usually named `testdisk.log` in the folder where you ran TestDisk; if you need TestDisk, download it from https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Download)
- Whether you want to print found files to the console and log file
- Whether you want to print extra files (not found in TestDisk's log) to the console and log file
- Any paths to exclude (entered as line-separated values containing the part to be excluded)

It will then process all files in the specified folder, comparing them to the log and reporting missing, found, and extra files.

## Testing

To test FilesCompare using the showcase materials:

1. **Download**: Get `Showcase.zip` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Kebluk-SoM-2025/FilesCompare.py/releases/) and extract it.
2. **Read Steps**: Open `Steps.md` in the showcase folder for instructions.
3. **Run**: Follow the steps in `Steps.md` to run FilesCompare with the sample files and check the results.
